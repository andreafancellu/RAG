Consent must be freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous. In order to obtain freely given consent, it must be \\ngiven on a voluntary basis. The element free implies a real choice by the data subject. Any element of inappropriate pressure or \\ninfluence which could affect the outcome of that choice renders the consent invalid. In doing so, the legal text takes a certain \\nimbalance between the controller and the data subject into consideration. For example, in an employer-employee relationship: The employee\\nmay worry that his refusal to consent may have severe negative consequences on his employment relationship, thus consent can only \\nbe a lawful basis for processing in a few exceptional circumstances. In addition, a so-called coupling prohibition or \\nprohibition of coupling or tying applies. Thus, the performance of a contract may not be made dependent upon the consent to process \\nfurther personal data, which is not needed for the performance of that contract.\\nFor consent to be informed and specific, the data subject must at least be notified about the controller\\'s identity, what kind of \\ndata will be processed, how it will be used and the purpose of the processing operations as a safeguard against function creep. \\nThe data subject must also be informed about his or her right to withdraw consent anytime. The withdrawal must be as easy as giving \\nconsent. Where relevant, the controller also has to inform about the use of the data for automated decision-making, the possible \\nrisks of data transfers due to absence of an adequacy decision or other appropriate safeguards.\\nThe consent must be bound to one or several specified purposes which must then be sufficiently explained. If the consent should \\nlegitimise the processing of special categories of personal data, the information for the data subject must expressly refer to this.\\nThere must always be a clear distinction between the information needed for the informed consent and information about other \\ncontractual matters.\\nLast but not least, consent must be unambiguous, which means it requires either a statement or a clear affirmative act. \\nConsent cannot be implied and must always be given through an opt-in, a declaration or an active motion, so that there is \\nno misunderstanding that the data subject has consented to the particular processing.
